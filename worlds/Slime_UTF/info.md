This tree farm was designed by [Activation](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZ840B5e4jmSNLr3QtZEv3w) and I to be both fast and lag-friendly. It has a 15 gametick harvest sequence for normal trees and a 21 gametick harvest sequence for acacia trees. The farm together with the withercage runs at under 10mspt in laboratory conditions. (superflat world, no other contraptions running)
